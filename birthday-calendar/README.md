# Birthday calendar dashboard

## Overview

Birthday Calendar is a 7-day calendar application that displays the day (Mon/Tue/Wed...Sun) a person's birthday falls on for a specific day. This assignment requires you to build a ReactJS application that processes a list of birthdays provided in JSON format and displays them on the calendar according to the day their birthday falls on. 

## Detailed Explanation

### Problem Statement

Birthday Calendar is a calendar application designed to display the birthdays of individuals for a day on which it falls. The application functions as follows:

1. **Input Data**: The application takes a list of birthdays in JSON format (The json data is provided below)
2. **Rendering on Calendar**: The application places each person's initials on the calendar according to the day their birthday falls on. Each person is represented by a square on the calendar.
3. **Rendering Rules**:
    - If a box on the calendar is empty, it should have the `day-empty` text or any image.
    - The name of each person is added as the title attribute for their respective box on the calendar.
    - People should be ordered inside the calendar based on their age, from youngest to oldest.
4. **Functionality**:
    - On the initial load, the calendar should display birthdays for the respective days with their initials.

### Task Details

Your task is to develop a ReactJS application that implements the Birthday Calendar functionality as described above. Ensure that the application adheres to the specified rendering rules and provides a seamless user experience for viewing birthdays on the calendar.
